        It is daunting to start learning a new topic.
        Most education sources use a punitive and restrictive approach.
        We have tendencies to categorized "hard" topic as only available to "smart" people
        This leads to that bubble in our head of subjects we categorized as "Rocket science"

        This is why we created Rocket Appliance.
        We want to make approaching new topics more attainable by creating a platform where passionate can provide entry point to their fields of expertise
        The games are meant to be short, easy and entertaining.
        Each elements of a game will allow the contributors to provide link where the learner can start their learning journey
